A simple RestClient-based Let's Freckle API client.

Only supports reading data.

h2. Example

<pre>
Freckle.establish_connection( :account  => "apitest",
                              :token    => "lx3gi6pxdjtjn57afp8c2bv1me7g89j" )

project = Freckle::Project.all.first
user = Freckle::User.by_email("test@example.com")

# all project's entries
project.entries

# all project's entries for specific people
project.entries(:people => [user.id])

# user's entries for a time range
user.entries(:from => "2010-07-01", :to => "2010-07-30")

# user's unbillable entries
user.entries(:billable => false)

# entries matching search params for multiple people, projects, with tags,
# in a date range, and only billable
Freckle::Entry.all( :billable => true,
                    :people => [user.id, 5543],
                    :projects => [project.id, 8475],
                    :tags => ["foobar"],
                    :from => "2010-06-01",
                    :to   => "2010-07-30")
</pre>
